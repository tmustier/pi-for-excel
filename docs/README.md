# Docs

Short, topic-based docs (mirrors Pi's layout). Keep deeper decisions close to the code they affect.

## Architecture & Process
- [Cleanup approach](./cleanup-approach.md)
- [Model/dependency update playbook](./model-updates.md)
- [UI architecture](../src/ui/README.md) — layout, styling, the `@layer` gotcha

## Tools
- [Tool behavior decisions](../src/tools/DECISIONS.md)

## Research (local only)
Research notes live in `research/` but are gitignored except `POC-LEARNINGS.md`.
